# Blockchain

## This repository is related to the development of a descentrilized Blockchain. 
### For a faster and more trouble-free appproach, I made use of Postman, which is a collaboration platform for API development (Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster), and Flask, which is a web framework (This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website).

### I also used Spyder (Scientific Python Development Environment), which is a free integrated development environment (IDE) that is included with Anaconda. It includes editing, interactive testing, debugging, and introspection features.

#### This project has only been possible thanks to the guiding provided by https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/blockchain .
